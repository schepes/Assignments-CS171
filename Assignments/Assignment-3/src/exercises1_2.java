    1- O(n)
    2- O(n)
    3- O(n*n) == O(n^2)
    4- O(n)
    5-O(n*n*n) == O(n^3)

    /*For exercise 2 we have from increasing order of growth rates:
    1- 2logn+3n+100logn - In big O notation we have - O(n)
    2- 4nlogn+2n - In big O notation we have - O(nlogn)
    3- n^3+nlogn - In big O notation we have - O(n^3)
    4- 4n+2^n+n^2+10n - In big O notation we have - O(2^n)

    So 1 is the lowest, 4 is the highest
